# DSRag_Ollama_InstructXl

Created a RAG Question-Answering system through LaangChain, trained on 2 GB of Data Science, Statistics, ML, Data Analytics, Python books in the form of PDFs.

I have used Llama-3 through Ollama for the LLM, Instruct-XL for the embeddings and FAISS for the database. 

My final best performing solution after exploring the LangChain functionalities, is through ConversationalRetrievalChain.
